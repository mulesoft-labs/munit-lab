munit-lab
=========
This is a crash course on Munit to jump start with the basic concepts. 

However, be aware that it is based on Munit version 3.4-M4-SNAPSHOT, thus, to be able to run it, you will have to install the mule-interceptor-module (https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-interceptor-module/tree/3.4.x) and Munit (https://github.com/mulesoft/munit - note that master branch has been renamed to munit-3.4.x) in your local maven repository.

Labs description on the wiki page.

Good luck!
